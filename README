gopherd
=======

A super simple forking gopherd that uses chroot + privdrop,
or pledge + unveil if available.

Compile & Install
=================

./configure ~
make install

Run
===

Any of these can work:

gopherd \*

gopherd 0.0.0.0:70

gopherd 192.168.0.1:70

gopherd 192.168.0.1:70 /var/pub/gopher

gopherd 192.168.0.1:70 /var/pub/gopher myhost.com

The gopherd expects to have a "map" file in the specified root
directory, which is by default /var/gopher.
